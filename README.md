## My process
My process was first to write the HTML code with the corresponding semantics, then create the styles for mobile devices and finally with a media query I made the design for larger devices.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I've gained experience using CSS Flexbox. That's my current goal, to become more proficient.

### Continued development

I'm going to focus on gaining experience in CSS so I can add JS to my future challenges.
